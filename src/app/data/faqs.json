        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Epoxy floor coating is a professional, multi-component resin system specifically engineered to bond permanently to concrete surfaces. Unlike paint or simple sealers that dry on top of the slab, epoxy works through a chemical reaction between resin and hardener that penetrates the concrete\u2019s pores and mechanically locks into the surface. This process creates a seamless, extremely durable layer that becomes part of the concrete rather than a surface film that can peel or wear away.\n\nProper installation begins with mechanical surface preparation, typically diamond grinding, which removes contaminants such as oil, dirt, curing compounds, and previous coatings. This step also opens the concrete\u2019s pores so the epoxy can bond correctly. After preparation, cracks and surface imperfections are repaired, moisture vapor levels are tested, and a primer may be applied to address humidity or groundwater conditions. The epoxy base coat is then installed, followed by optional decorative elements such as color flakes or metallic pigments, and finished with a protective topcoat.\n\nOnce cured, epoxy creates a non-porous, moisture-resistant surface that resists stains, chemicals, abrasion, and impact. This makes epoxy flooring ideal for garages, commercial facilities, workshops, retail spaces, and even residential interiors. In coastal environments like Bluffton and Hilton Head Island, professionally installed epoxy systems provide reliable performance despite humidity, salt air, and temperature changes."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The best material for a garage floor coating depends on how the space is used, the condition of the concrete, moisture exposure, and your long-term performance goals. Professional garage floor systems typically fall into three categories: epoxy, polyaspartic, and polyurea coatings. Each offers distinct advantages when installed correctly.\n\nEpoxy coatings are widely used because they provide excellent durability, strong chemical resistance, and extensive design flexibility. Decorative color flakes, solid colors, and metallic finishes allow homeowners to customize their garage while improving functionality. Epoxy is particularly effective for garages used for parking vehicles, storage, or light workshop activity.\n\nPolyaspartic and polyurea coatings are advanced systems known for rapid curing times, superior moisture tolerance, and enhanced UV stability. These qualities make them especially well-suited for coastal South Carolina garages where humidity and sunlight are constant factors. Many of these systems allow same-day or next-day return to service.\n\nAt Palmetto Epoxy, we evaluate slab condition, moisture levels, traffic demands, and design preferences before recommending a system. This ensures your garage floor performs reliably, remains safe, and maintains its appearance for years."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The cost of epoxy flooring in South Carolina typically ranges from $4 to $10 per square foot, depending on several project-specific factors. These include the size of the area, the condition of the existing concrete, the type of epoxy or resin system selected, decorative options, and whether moisture mitigation is required.\n\nIn coastal areas such as Bluffton and Hilton Head Island, moisture testing is especially important. High humidity and groundwater levels may require specialized primers or vapor barriers to ensure long-term adhesion. Decorative flake systems, metallic epoxy finishes, custom colors, and additional protective topcoats can also influence pricing.\n\nResidential garage floors often fall toward the lower end of the cost range, while commercial or industrial projects may require thicker systems, heavier surface preparation, and higher-performance coatings. While epoxy flooring may cost more upfront than paint or basic sealers, it offers significantly longer lifespan, improved durability, and lower maintenance costs over time.\n\nPalmetto Epoxy provides free evaluations and transparent pricing so customers understand exactly what they are investing in and why the system selected is the best solution for their space."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Epoxy floor installation timelines vary based on the size of the project, the condition of the concrete, the coating system selected, and environmental conditions. Most residential garage floors can be completed in one to two days, including surface preparation, crack repair, coating application, and curing time.\n\nCommercial projects or larger spaces may take several days, particularly if extensive surface repairs, moisture mitigation, or decorative finishes are required. Surface preparation is the most critical and time-intensive step and should never be rushed, as it directly impacts adhesion and longevity.\n\nFast-curing polyaspartic and polyurea systems can significantly reduce downtime. These systems often allow foot traffic within hours and vehicle traffic within 24 hours, making them ideal for busy households and commercial environments.\n\nPalmetto Epoxy carefully schedules each project to minimize disruption while maintaining strict quality standards. Proper curing time is always respected to ensure the finished floor performs as designed."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A professionally installed epoxy floor can last between 10 and 20 years in residential environments and 5 to 15 years in commercial or industrial settings. Longevity depends on traffic levels, exposure to chemicals, moisture conditions, and routine maintenance.\n\nResidential garages that experience standard vehicle traffic and occasional spills typically see minimal wear over time. Commercial spaces with heavy foot traffic or equipment may require periodic recoating to maintain appearance and protection.\n\nIn coastal South Carolina, moisture control plays a significant role in lifespan. Floors installed without proper moisture testing are more susceptible to bubbling or delamination. Palmetto Epoxy uses professional testing methods and moisture-tolerant systems designed for the Lowcountry climate.\n\nWith routine cleaning and proper care, epoxy flooring remains one of the most durable and cost-effective surface solutions available."
