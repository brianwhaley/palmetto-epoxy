        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Epoxy floor coating is a multi-part resin system that chemically bonds to concrete to create a seamless, durable, and moisture-resistant surface. It works by penetrating the concrete pores and curing into a hard protective layer that resists stains, chemicals, abrasion, and impact."
